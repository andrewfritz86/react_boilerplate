# React Boilerplate

This is a simple scaffold to get a React App up and running in the browser.

Comes with:

- React (for components)
- Webpack (and HTML, CSS, Babel loaders)
- Babel (for transpilation)

By default:

- Uses normalize and skeleton for CSS boilerplate
- Assumes `index.js` as Webpack entry point

To use:

- `npm install` to grab dependencies
- `npm start` to build assets and kick off dev server

Changelog:

- 2/2/19 - Initial Commit
- 2/12/19 - Add CSS loaders, Normalize, Skeleton
